For this project's walking skeleton, users should only be able to use a single Kanban Board with only three columns: “To-Do”, “In-Progress”, and “Done”. Allow users to create tasks that only contain a name and description. Tasks should be saved to the database but since there is no login process, all users see the same tasks and single Kanban Board. Make the GUI as simple as possible - that means users do not need to drag tasks between columns.
